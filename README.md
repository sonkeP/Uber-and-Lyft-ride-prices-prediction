# Uber-and-Lyft-ride-prices-prediction-

## Introduction
This project explores the dynamic pricing of ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft, which fluctuate based on real-time demand and supply. Unlike fixed public transport fares, these prices are influenced by factors such as time of day and weather conditions. Peak demand is expected during morning and evening commute hours, while adverse weather conditions like rain or snow likely increase reliance on these services. This analysis aims to quantify the impact of these factors on pricing, offering insights for consumers and providers to better navigate and anticipate fare changes in the ride-sharing market.

## Data Sets
### Cab Rides Dataset
- **Domain:** Transportation (ride-sharing services)
- **Source:** Kaggle - Uber Lyft Cab Prices (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravi72munde/uber-lyft-cab-prices?resource=download&select=weather.csv)
- **Size and Features:** 88.76 MB, includes distance, cab_type, timestamp, destination, source, price, surge_multiplier, id, product_id, and name. These features provide detailed insights into each ride, including type, duration, and pickup/drop-off locations.

### Weather Dataset
- **Domain:** Meteorological
- **Source:** Kaggle - Uber Lyft Cab Prices (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravi72munde/uber-lyft-cab-prices?resource=download&select=weather.csv)
- **Size and Features:** Includes temp, location, clouds, pressure, rain, timestamp, humidity, and wind. These variables offer detailed weather conditions corresponding to the times and locations of the cab rides.

### Target Variable
- **Price:** The primary target variable from the cab rides dataset, reflecting the cost of a cab ride. This variable is essential for predictive modeling, with weather conditions and ride attributes serving as input variables.

## Research Problems
### Problem 1: Predictive Modeling of Ride-Sharing Prices
- **Problem Statement:** Develop a predictive model to estimate the price of ride-sharing services based on various factors, including time of day, weather conditions, ride distance, and type of service (Uber or Lyft).
- **Why:** This analysis will help consumers anticipate costs and aid service providers in adjusting their pricing strategies under different conditions.

### Problem 2: Impact of Weather Conditions on Ride Prices
- **Problem Statement:** Analyze how different weather conditions affect the pricing of ride-sharing services by examining correlations between weather variables (temperature, wind speed, etc.) and ride prices.
- **Why:** Understanding this relationship can provide insights into demand fluctuations caused by weather changes and help in developing strategies to manage ride availability and pricing.

### Problem 3: Time-Based Demand Analysis
- **Problem Statement:** Investigate how the demand for ride-sharing services varies with time, focusing on different times of the day and possibly days of the week, and how this variation influences pricing.
- **Why:** This can reveal peak demand times, aiding in better resource allocation and pricing strategies for ride-sharing providers.

## Potential Solutions
### Predictive Modeling of Ride-Sharing Prices
- **Solution:** Implement multiple linear regression and other machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors) to predict ride prices. Use features like time of day, weather conditions, ride distance, and type of service.
- **Plan:** Collect and preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance using appropriate metrics.

### Impact of Weather Conditions on Ride Prices
- **Solution:** Analyze correlations between weather conditions and ride prices using statistical methods and machine learning models.
- **Plan:** Isolate relevant features from the weather dataset, merge with ride data, and perform regression analysis to quantify impact.

### Time-Based Demand Analysis
- **Solution:** Develop models to analyze how ride demand varies with time and its effect on pricing.
- **Plan:** Segregate data by time intervals, apply machine learning models, and evaluate demand patterns.

## Evaluations
- **Evaluation Method:** Use hold-out or N-fold cross-validation to evaluate models.
- **Metrics:** 
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Measure the accuracy of price predictions.
  - **RÂ² Score:** Evaluate how well data fit the regression model.
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Assess the average squared difference between observed and predicted values.
- **Model Comparison:** Compare performance metrics across different models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors).

## Expected Outcomes
- **Predictive Modeling:** Accurate prediction of ride-sharing prices based on various influencing factors.
- **Weather Impact Analysis:** Quantified impact of weather conditions on ride prices, providing insights for dynamic pricing strategies.
- **Time-Based Demand Analysis:** Identification of peak demand times and their influence on pricing, aiding in better resource allocation and pricing strategies for ride-sharing services.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide valuable insights into the factors influencing ride-sharing prices, enabling consumers to anticipate costs and service providers to optimize pricing strategies. By leveraging data on ride specifics and weather conditions, we aim to develop robust predictive models and perform comprehensive analyses that enhance understanding of the ride-sharing market dynamics.
